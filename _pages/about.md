I am a research fellow in environmental economics at the [Paris Saclay Applied Economics](https://psae.versailles-grignon.hub.inrae.fr/) ([INRAE](https://www.inrae.fr/en)) research unit.

From 2022 to 2023, I was a postdoctoral reseacher in the Department of Economics at the [Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences](https://www.slu.se/en/departments/economics/research/research-groups/environmental-economics/) in Uppsala, Sweden.

I completed my PhD in economics at the [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/) and the [University Paris 1 Panth√©on-Sorbonne](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/) in August 2022. 

My research projects focus on the economics of pollution and the evaluation of environmental policies, exploiting both spatial and trade theory as well as an extensive range of French and Swedish data.
